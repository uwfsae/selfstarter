        What is Formula SAE?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Formula SAE is an international collegiate competition in which universities from around the world design, build, and race formula-style racecars to compete in a multifaceted design competition. We at the University of Washington have been competing for the last 25 years.

        A racecar in college?
      </h3>
      <p>
        FSAE is <em style="font-style: italic;">the</em> most valuable experience our team members have in college. While classes are important, real world engineering starts in our shop. We design and manufacture nearly every part of our cars in a well justified engineering exercise that just so happens to go 0-60 in 3.2s.

        Are you any good?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Short answer: yes.  Last year we competed in 3 competitions, and after overcoming untimely issues in Lincoln we placed 6th in Germany.  In the current world rankings we are ranked 31st of 511.  We are one of the few teams in the world who compete in both the combustion and electric divisions.
